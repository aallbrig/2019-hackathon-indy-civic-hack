      <p>
        Things get complicated sometimes. In those times, wouldn't it be nice to speak with someone?

      <p>
        That's the idea behind this proposed Call Center! Soteria's Lighthouse provides a call center phone number so that you can call in for more personalized help.

      <h3>Hoosiers Helping Hoosiers</h3>
      <p>
        This solution requires operating a call center. Be it a small business or the city of Indianapolis, operating a local call center would allow Hoosier to help other Hoosiers with their personal reentry experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        A call center means jobs! What Hoosier doesn't like job creation?
      </p>
      <h3>A Jobs Program for Formerly Incarcerated</h3>
      <p>
        This program attains sustainability by allow formerly incarcerated to apply for jobs to the call center. Once someone has successfully reentered and integrated with society, what better way to give back to the community than to help others who find themselves at the beginning of their personal reentry experience.
