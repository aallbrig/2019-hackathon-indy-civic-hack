### Soteria Acolytes

In mythology, Soteria was the goddess of salvation. The team name reflects how our solution serves as salvation for those reentering from a criminal justice by making the task of following the "straight and narrow" path easier and more technologically engaging.

Please read more about Soteria on her [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteria_(mythology))

### JUDGING CRITERIA
The Challenges will be graded against the following set of criteria:

- Addressing the Challenge (50%): Demo should be able to show how the solution meets (or will meet the objective). Some,
but not all functionality, may be present in the prototype; but, the demo should show how the
solution solves the main problem.

- Creativity and Innovation (25%): How creative or unique the
solution is to meeting the objective.

- Feasibility and Sustainability (15%): The demo should be
able to describe how it can be sustained over time. Look for ease of support, maintenance...use of
open source/public resources, what would a potential install or roll-out look like.

- Accomplishment and Learning (10%): How much did the team learn from the customers to
inform the solution, how nuanced is the solution, how many details from the customers are
included?
