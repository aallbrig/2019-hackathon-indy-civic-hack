# 2019 Hackathon Indy Civic Hack

For this hackathon, I am going to be focusing on the criminal justice re-entry program challenge. The challenge is to make anyone going through the reentry program have an easier time, using technology.

## Solution

The solution I've come up with is to centralize critical resources into a mobile friendly dashboard that particicants in the reentry program can visit to help them on their journey.

Here is a [link to the solution dashboard](https://aallbrig.github.io/2019-hackathon-indy-civic-hack/)


There is a voice assistant component to this solution as well. In order to stay current with modern communications, those who are a part of the reentry program who also have access to voice assistances should be able to interact with them to help them on their journey as well.

### Soteria Acolytes

In mythology, Soteria was the goddess of salvation. The team name reflects how our solution serves as salvation for those reentering from a criminal justice by making the task of following the "straight and narrow" path easier and more technologically engaging.

Please read more about Soteria on her [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteria_(mythology))

### JUDGING CRITERIA
The Challenges will be graded against the following set of criteria:

- Addressing the Challenge (50%): Demo should be able to show how the solution meets (or will meet the objective). Some,
but not all functionality, may be present in the prototype; but, the demo should show how the
solution solves the main problem.

- Creativity and Innovation (25%): How creative or unique the
solution is to meeting the objective.

- Feasibility and Sustainability (15%): The demo should be
able to describe how it can be sustained over time. Look for ease of support, maintenance...use of
open source/public resources, what would a potential install or roll-out look like.

- Accomplishment and Learning (10%): How much did the team learn from the customers to
inform the solution, how nuanced is the solution, how many details from the customers are
included?
